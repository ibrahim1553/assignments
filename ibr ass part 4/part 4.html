        <p>Swat District is centered on the Valley of Swat, usually referred to simply as Swat, which is a <br>
           natural geographic region surrounding the Swat River. The valley was a major centre of early <br>
           Buddhism under the ancient kingdom of Gandhara, and was a major centre of Gandharan <br>
           Buddhism, with pockets of Buddhism persisting in the valley until the 10th century, after which <br>
           the area became largely Muslim.[4][5] Until 1969, Swat was part of the Yusafzai State of Swat, a <br>
           self-governing princely state that was inherited by Pakistan following its independence from<br>
           British rule. The region was seized by the Tehrik-i-Taliban in late-2007 until Pakistani control was<br>
           re-established in mid-2009.[6][7]<br></p>

        <p>The average elevation of Swat is 980 m (3,220 ft),[5] resulting in a considerably cooler and<br>
           wetter climate compared to the rest of Pakistan. With lush forests, verdant alpine meadows<br>
           and snow-capped mountains, Swat is one of the country's most popular tourist destinations.[8][9]<br></p>
