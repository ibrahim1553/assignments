        <h4>A professional conference is a meeting of professionals in a given subject or profession<br>
            dealing with organizational matters, matters concerning the status of the profession, and scientific or technical developments.</h4>

            subject matter expertise, extend your knowledge of resources, introduce you to new theory, methods or tools, gain ideas <br>
            for new programs and workshops, develop new skills or simply refresh your interest in and enthusiasm for managing <br>
