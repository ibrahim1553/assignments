        <p><h3>AIR FRYER DONUTS: </h3>
        If you have an air fryer, you know all about the temptation to make everything in it. It’s kind of<br>
        funny because all an air fryer really is, is a tiny convection oven with lots of hot air blowing<br>
        around. Technically, if you have a convection oven, you have a giant air fryer. But there’s<br>
        something about an air fryer that just seems magic. And what’s even more magic is that you can <br>
        fry donuts in it.<br></p>

        <p><h3>KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN:</h3>
            Korean fried chicken is classically double fried extra crispy wings and drummettes that are then<br>
            coated in a sticky, sweet, and spicy sauce. It’s like buffalo wings amped up with the power of <br>
            gochujang.<br></p>

            <h2>Teriyaki Chicken</h2>
            <h2>Chicken Katsu</h2>
            <h2>Thai Basil Chicken</h2>

            <p>TERIYAKI CHICKEN: Teriyaki chicken is one of my faves. This is a a teriyaki chicken bowl to take you to Tokyo. There’s something about that sweet and savory sauce on chicken that gets me every time. A really good bowl of teriyaki chicken reminds me of eating skewer after skewer of yakitori in the narrow back alleys of Tokyo.</p>
            <p>CHICKEN KATSU: Juicy, tender chicken, with crispy panko breadcrumbs on the outside, fluffy rice and crunchy cabbage?! Dream meal! Almost every culture has a breaded chicken cutlet and I love them all but chicken katsu has a special little katsu shape in my heart.</p>
            <p>THAI BASIL CHICKEN:  LOVE Thai basil chicken. It gets my heart rate going not only because it’s perfectly spicy but also because it’s delicious. This is a super easy stir fry that is an incredible taste payoff for minimal prep. Goodbye delivery and hello home cooked meal!</p>
